# Testing

This plugin uses the [Gut](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) test framework addon for Godot to implement unit and integration tests. For advanced operation, review of Gut's extensive wiki is recommended. This document will describe the most basic usage patterns for this project.

_**Note:** This document can eventually be moved into the repository's wiki._

## Running Tests

The easiest way to run all of this project's unit and integration tests is from the [command line](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Command-Line). First, ensure that your shell has the `godot` alias defined. For example, one might add the following to their `~/.zshrc` file on macOS and then re-source (or simply restart) their shell session.

```bash
alias godot='/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot'
```

Next, change into the `plugin/` subdirectory of this repository.

```bash
cd plugin/
```

From here, the all tests can be executed and the Gut test console opened with the following command.

```bash
godot -d -s --path $PWD addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd
```

## Creating Tests

Tests exist in the following directories.

- `plugin/test/unit` holds small tests of specific units/components/classes/methods.
- `plugin/test/integration` holds large tests of the entire plugin's functionality combined.

Gut has an extensive API for writing tests. Recommended reading includes its [Quick Start page](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Quick-Start) and its [Creating Tests page](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut/wiki/Creating-Tests).
